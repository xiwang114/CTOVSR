Brief Summary
The Chinese Traditional Opera Video Super-Resolution (CTOVSR) dataset is a large-scale, high-quality resource designed for the digital restoration and super-resolution of aged Chinese opera videos. As a crystallization of human civilization recognized by UNESCO, traditional opera footage faces significant degradation over time. This dataset provides 900 paired low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) video sequences to support research in video super-resolution, digital heritage preservation, and computer vision. By accurately modeling real-world degradation, CTOVSR aims to bridge the gap between historical video archives and modern restoration technologies, ensuring the preservation and accessibility of this invaluable cultural heritage for future generations.
Description of the Data and File Structure
The CTOVSR dataset is structured into paired LR-HR video sequences, meticulously prepared to reflect authentic degradation processes while maintaining strict spatial and temporal alignment.
Total Content: 900 LR-HR video sequence pairs.
Sequence Length: Each pair contains 100 consecutive frames.
